# nutri-app

<!-- **Due to the nature of third party API integration, some links
may not be operational. The third party API is by not controlled by
the developer of this app.** -->

This app uses the nutri-app api available through www.rapidapi.com
and all queries are done through the api to gain access to their DB of recipes.

This app uses MongoDB as it's own DB and houses the users information, i.e. username and password, saved recipes, favorites, and so on... The recipes themselves are free to use.

In order to run this app, clone the repository, navigate to client2
folder, run npm i
This will install all dependencies for the React (Client) side
Then cd into the server folder and run npm i
This will install all dependencies for the server side.
While still in the server folder, run nodemon server.js
Open another terminal and navigate to the client2 folder again,
and run npm start

This app was developed by Bryan Huffstutler
